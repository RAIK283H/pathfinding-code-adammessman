# Pathfinding Starter Code

I interpreted the random path the mean that the player should be able to visit a node it has visited before in order to avoid the player getting stuck in an infinite loop. I also interpreted this to mean that the player should be able to go back to the start node and back and forth between nodes to maintain a higher degree of randomness. The player should be able to visit the exit node, even without visiting the target node.
